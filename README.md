# EpiContactTrace

EpiContactTrace is a package for facilitating livestock contact tracing
and risk based surveillance.  EpiContactTrace uses the network
parameters: in-degree, out-degree, ingoing contact-chain and outgoing
contact-chain, which are relevant for forward- and backward
contact-tracing respectively. The package can generate reports to
visualize the contact structure on the farm level.

You can track (and contribute to) development of `EpiContactTrace` at
https://github.com/stewid/EpiContactTrace.
